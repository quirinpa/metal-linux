<h1>Metal linux</h1>

<p>An attempt to port Linux to WebAssembly (baby steps).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	Read stdin and write to stdout. For now, that's about it, and even that
	is incomplete. I've made many mistakes along the way but I really want
	to do this right, or at least to learn from the best. It is true that
	this might be overkill, but I think you might just be a little grumpy
	today, and I already put all this work forward, so. I'm not going to
	stop just because you don't like it. Feel free to fix it, thou!

<ul>
	<li>Syscalls that are not defined issue a runtime error</li>
	<li>Debug syscalls may be easily defined which have a set return value
	(argument or constant). These print out their names, pid, and their
	arguments when called.</li>
</ul>
